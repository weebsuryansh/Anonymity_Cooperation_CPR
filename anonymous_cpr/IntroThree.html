        COST OF COAL EXTRACTION IS DETERMINED BY THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION:
    </h5>
    \[

    \]
    WHERE,<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TOTAL_EXTRACTION = COAL EXTRACTED BY THE WHOLE GROUP
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>
        COST WILL OFCOURSE BE DEDUCTED FROM THE PRICE OF COAL EXTRACTED AND HENCE, YOUR PAYOFF WILL BE DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:
    </h4>

    <h4>
        IF WE CONSIDER ALL 10 PLAYERS EXTRACT EQUAL AMOUNT OF COAL, THE PAYOFF VS EXTRACTION GRAPH WILL LOOK AS FOLLOWS:

        YOU CAN ONLY EXTRACT UPTO {{ max_extraction }} TO PREVENT HOARDING OF RESOURCES!!! YOU CAN EITHER DECIDE TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS TO KEEP TOTAL EXTRACTION LOW TO MAXIMISE PAYOFF OR ACT SELFISHLY. IT IS UPTO YOU TO DECIDE.

        NOTE: EXTRACTIONS FROM ALL THE PLAYERS WILL BE ANONYMOUS AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH THEM DURING THE WHOLE GAME UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE.
